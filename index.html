          According to Statistics Canada, 1.3% to 1.93% of bachelor’s degree graduates of
          post-secondary institutions in Ontario from 2012 to 2021 were from British Columbia.
          This group partially represents students whose home is in Vancouver but study in Toronto.

        <h2 class="context-title">When Are Flights Cheapest or Most Expensive?</h2>
    
        <p class="context-text">
          Using our manually collected dataset of flights from Vancouver to Toronto,
          we averaged the lowest and highest ticket prices for each month. This
          reveals which times of year tend to be the most affordable and which
          months are more expensive to fly.

          Here we group all flights by the week of the month they were searched.
          This helps reveal whether tickets tend to be cheaper at the beginning or
          end of each month.

          Here we arrange our flights like a calendar, with months as rows and days
          of the week as columns. Darker cells show days when the average lowest
          ticket price is higher, while lighter cells indicate cheaper days to fly.

          Each point represents a flight we searched, plotted by its departure time
          and ticket price. This lets us see whether certain times of day tend to
          be cheaper or more expensive to fly from Vancouver to Toronto.
