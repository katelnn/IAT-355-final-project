            For these students, air travel often becomes a recurring part of their academic life.
            Flights may be necessary to return home during academic breaks, holidays, family events,

            Looking across the year, prices are most unpredictable at the end of 2025, then become
            much steadier throughout 2026. In December 2025, the highest-price line shoots up with
            extreme spikes (including a peak around $2,586). In 2026, prices follow a more seasonal
            pattern: summer sits higher, while fall (especially October) becomes cheaper again.

            Each box shows the typical price range (middle 50% of days), the black line marks the median,
            and the whiskers show unusually cheap or expensive days—so you can compare both cost and volatility.

            The cheapest months to fly are January–April, while the most expensive (and least predictable)

            This chart zooms in on a smaller question: does timing within a month matter?
            We grouped flights into Week 1 to Week 5 and calculated the average cheapest price
            and average most expensive price for each week.

          <p class="desc">
            There isn’t a strong “end of month = always more expensive” pattern. Cheapest-price averages stay fairly
            consistent across weeks, but the most-expensive prices spike in Week 3—suggesting mid-month is where the
            risk of paying a premium is highest. Week 5 isn’t the most expensive, which challenges the assumption
            that prices steadily rise toward month-end.

            Each cell shows the average ticket price for a specific month + weekday combination. Lighter cells mean
            cheaper fares, darker cells mean pricier ones—so you can quickly spot “good days” and seasonal shifts.

          <h2>Summary & Insights</h2>

          <p class="desc">
            Overall, our visualizations show that flight prices from Vancouver to Toronto don’t change smoothly
            — they swing based on when you travel. For students, that matters because trips are usually tied to
            fixed milestones (final exams, semester breaks, co-op start dates, family events), so the “wrong”
            timing can quickly blow a budget.
          </p>

          <p class="desc">
            Once the month is chosen, the smaller decisions become “risk management.” Week-by-week, the cheapest
            averages don’t shift dramatically, but premium prices spike more in certain weeks. The day and time-of-day
            views reinforce that idea: weekday patterns shift by season, and certain times cluster with pricier tickets.
            For students, the practical takeaway is: lock in the right season first, then stay flexible on day/time
            to avoid premium-price traps.
